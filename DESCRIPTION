Description: A basic R package which uses OpenMP to parallelize sections of
    the C code. This package also includes the configure and Makevars scripts
    so that OpenMP can be linked if it is available, and silently ignored
    if it is not.  Special care is taken with the macOS platform where
    the user must manually install the header and lib, as these do not come
    by default.
